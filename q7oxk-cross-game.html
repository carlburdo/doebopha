Of of my favorite shows ever, I'd call it underrated but anyone who's seen it loves it, maybe under viewed/exposed would be a better way of putting it.

As the title suggests, I want to watch Cross Game but not many people talk about it on r/anime or elsewhere. I mean the show has an 8.51 rating on MAL but i dont see people recommending this anime. Since it has 50 episodes I dont want to feel like I wasted my time so I wanted to ask certain things. 1) Does it have a satisfying ending? 2) Is the romance good? 3) Are the baseball matches interesting and fun/hype.

One thing I do kind of miss from early in the game's life were banners that weren't really based on a specific game per say but rather a specific theme. This allowed for characters from various different Fire Emblem games to be included, like the Family Bonds banner (which added Eirika, Ephraim, Seliph, and Julia) and the Sibling Bonds banner (which added Lachesis, Eldigan, Olwen, Reinhardt, Klein, and Sanaki). We haven't really gotten a banner like that ever since aside from say the Farfetched.
